Hello, I'm @RyanDSteiner. I'm a junior CS student at ASU, and a former math teacher looking to work in education technology. 

Outside of my studies, I am working on using building applications in Java that could potentially be used in a classroom setting. 
I recently completed a prototype for a Geoboard Puzzle, which could be used as part of a grade school geometry lesson, please check it out!
