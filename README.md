Hello, I'm @RyanDSteiner. I'm a junior CS student at ASU, and a former math teacher looking to work in education technology. 

Outside of my studies, I am working on using building applications in Java that could potentially be used in a classroom setting. 
At the moment, I am working to learn more of the capabilities of JavaFX to build GUI, and I will put the results of that tinkering on here along with school projects.
